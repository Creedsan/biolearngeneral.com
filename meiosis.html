          <h3>Meiosis</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p>A special type of cell division which is exclusively for gametes (sperm and egg cell) is called meiosis. Meiosis consists of two sets of cell division (Meiosis I and Meiosis Il) resulting in four daughter cells having only half of the number of chromosomes of its parent cell (haploid). In humans, the chromosomes are reduced to only half of thei set of the chromosome number (23) so that when the gametes undergo fertilization, it will add up and return to its original complete set of chromosomes.</p><p>What differentiates mitosis from meiosis is in terms of three important events. First meiosis allows the exchange of qenetic material between homoloqous chromosomes when they line up side by side during prophase I (synapsis). This exchange of genetic material is called crossing over which can occur between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Secondly, the independent assortment of the chromosomes increases the genetic variability among the daughter cells produced during meiosis (Figure 2.7). For instance, if there are n pairs of chromosomes in the parent cell, independent assortment produces 2n possible combinations in its daughter cells. Thus, a limitless number of genetic combinations are possible in the resulting cells of meiosis. Lastly, alleles of the Same gene separate during meiosis. These characteristics increase the genetic variability in the offspring and are important in understanding genetics and evolution in sexuaily reproducing organisms.</p><p>The steps in meiosis are summarized in the table below. Draw each event in the box on the left column. Make. sure to show the following parts: cell membrane, spindle fiber, chromosome, and centrosome, together with other essential parts of cell division Illustrate using 1 cell with 4 chromosomes as the starting point (2n-4).</p><p>At the end of meiosis in animal cell, the cell will differentiate into sperm cells and egg cell for male and female, respectively. However, there is unequal cytokinesis of female reproductive cells during meiotic division. This results in one large egg cell with tiny short-lived polar nuclei.</p><p>How is meiosis then important to a sexually reproducing organism? Meiosis reduces the number of chromosomes from 2 sets to 1 set. This is essential as this requlates the chromosome number (e.a. n-23 for humans) wherein each parent contributes half the genes needed to produce a new individual. It also increases the genetic variability in the population of organisms from one generation to the next.  Introducing variations to the population is very important in the process of evolution. </p>
