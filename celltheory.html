          <h3>The Cell Theory</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p> Prior to the invention of the very first microscope, everything that could not be seen by the naked eye was unexplainable. In 1665, Robert Hooke was able to observe in a piece of cork specimen structures which appear as tiny compartments similar to small rooms that are fitted to each other (Fiqure 1.3). Hooke coined the word "cell" to describe these chamber-like structures and later became famous.</p> <p>Hooke thought that only plants and fungi were the only ones made up of cells. Until 1676 Anton van Leeuwenhoek published his observations on tiny living organisms which he named animalcules. It was believed that Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe under his microscope the structure of a red blood cell of different animals as well as a sperm cell. Between the Hooke-Leeuwenhoek discoveries up to mid-nineteenth century, very litte cell advancements were made. It was probably due to the widely accepted, traditional belief on the theory of spontaneous generation which supposes that living things may arise from non-living matter; for instance, maggots and flies can exist from rotting meat. It was only refuted when Louis Pasteur's experiment disproved that theory.</p> <p>One of the leading botanists in his time, Robert Brown in 1831 was able to compare diverse kinds of plant specimens under the microscope. He markedly indicated that there is one common thing about themâ€”they are all composed of cells, and inside the cell is a dark dense spot which he termed as the nucleus. A few years later, German botanist Matthias Schleiden (1838) concluded that all plant parts are made of cells. Iheodor Schwann (1839), also a botanist and a close friend of Schleiden, stated that all animal tissues are composed of cells, too. In 1858, Rudolf Virchow concluded that all cells come from pre-existing cells.</p> <p>The discoveries made by Hooke, Leeuwenhoek, Schleiden, Schwann, Virchow, and others led to the formulation of the cell theory. The cell theory is universal for all l living things, no matter how simple or complex, tiny or huge it is. This theory can be summed up into three basic components: 1) alliving organisms are composedof one or more cells: 2) the cellis the basic unit of life in all living things;and (3) all clls come fom pre-existing cells.</p> <p>The three postulates of the cell theory offer the basis on how an object is considered as a living thing. All living things are fundamentally made up ofcell this entails no exception no matter how simple or complex that organism is or to what environment it is exposed to or what course of evolution it has gone through. An organism can be unicellular (one-celled) or multicellular. A single-celled organism can perform all the essential functions which enable it to grow, survive, and reproduce. Multicellular organisms are more complex in structure and function but the mechanism on how it is able to live is still the same with the simple life forms. Strongly related to this is the second postulate which states that the cell is the basic unit of life. The cell operates similar to a complete machine which has many compartments that perform different but interrelated and interconnected functions. The cell is a completely functional entity that possesses characteristics which distinguish it from inanimatei objects. Finally, all cells come from pre-existing cells, which signifies that cells cannot be spontaneously created but it will always be a product of reproduction from a pre existing cell (Mazzarello 1999).</p>
