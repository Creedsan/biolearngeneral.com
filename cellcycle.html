          <h3>Cell Cycle</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p> Active eukaryotic cells undergo a series of phases to make new cells and sustain the demand of a living organism. The observable phase under the microscope where you see the chromosomes and nuclei)is the M phase or mitosis phase. The M phase is very short in comparison to the larger time that the cell is undergoing the interphase. During the interphase, DNA exists as chromatin rathef than as chromosomes. The interphase is divided into three phases (Figure 2.1).</p> <p>The first stage of the interphase is the G1 phase (gap 1). This is the "decision making step" when the dell decides if it wil start the cell cycle or rest or permanently exit the cell cycle to become a differentiated cell (G, phase) (Figure 2.1; 2.2a-b). If the cell decides to pass through the G, phase, then it will commit to undergo the S phase and finish the remainder of the cell cyle. In the next phase, the S (synthesis) phase, DNA replication occurs where the nuclues becomes larger with twice the amount of DNA. Then, the G2, phase is where further growth and final preparation for mitosis happen (Figure 2.2c). The M phase that follows the G2 phase will be discussed in detail in the next section. At the end of the M phase, the cell undergoes a physical division via cytokinesis. The cytoplasmic membrane separates (in the case of animal cell) or new membrane beconhes deposited (plant cell) to create two new cells (Figure 2.2d).</p> <p>It is important to understand that at the start of the cell cycle, a eukaryotic cell  is usually diploid (2n). Despite the fact that the DNA content doubles during S phase, the replicated strand is only a duplicate copy of the other; thus, it is termed as sister chromatids. These are not considered as separate chromosomes. This will then be divided into each of the daughter cells at the end of M phase or mitosis.</p> <p>Mitosis begins with prophase where chromatin in the nucleus supercoilsi or condenses to form chromosomes (Figure 2.3). These chromosomes are then recognizable under the light microscope. Look at Fiqure 2.4. to understand thel different morphology that the DNA will take during various stages of compaction in cell reproduction.</p> <p>A condensed chromosome is made up of two identical sister chromatids that are densely packed and constricted in a region termed as centromere. This is also the phase when mitotic spindle starts to form on the outside of the nucleus. The mitotic spindle involved in this process originates from the centrosome, which is composed of paired centrioles that have been duplicated during interphase. Asters radiate on the peripheral of these centrosomes, hence pushing the duplicated centrosomes apart. The transition staqe from prophase to metaphase is known as prometaphase. i During prometaphase, the nuclear envelope starts to break down allowing the spindle to interact with the chromosomes. The spindle fibers then bind to the kinetochore (found on the centromere region). When the kinetochores of the sister chromatids are attached to the spindle fibers, the chromosomes move midway between poles until it aligns at one plate, the metaphase plate. Therefore, the next stage is known as metaphase. The equilibrium "central" positioning of the chromosomes means that i one of the sister chromatids has an attached spindle fiber on one centrosome and thei other sister chromatid is attached to the other centrosome (Figure 2.5).</p> <p>A condensed chromosome is made up of two identical sister chromatids that are densely packed and constricted in a region termed as centromere.

This newly separated chromatid is called chromosomes. As the poles move further apart, the cellelongates the spindle. Telophase begins when the chromosomes at the end of each pole decondense. A new nuclear envelope forms and chromosome further decondenses into a chromatin.</p><p>In order to finally create two new cells, cytokinesis should take place. This is not a compulsory phase since some cells finish cell division with multiple copies of chromosome set such as the liver cell. For some animal cells, cytokinesis is initiated during anaphase where the plane of cleavage is set at right angle to the mitotic spindles. The cell then divides in half from the action of actin filaments that constitute the contractile rings along the cleavage plane. This process should be correctly done in animal cell to ensure that the cell divides at the correct plane and the division happens at the right time when the sister chromatids have separated. In plant cells, due to the absence of centrosome in plants, the fibers are barrel-shaped instead of spindle. shaped. The cell wall of the plant is also rigid; thus, cleavage formation is not possible to occur. Plant cell uses a densely fibrous phraqmoplast fiber that grows out toward the "old" cell wall equivalent to the cleavage plane in animal cells.Membrane vesicles are then produced from the phragmoplast which travel or lide across the fiber to form a new sheet of cytoplasmic membrane which is known as the cell plate (Ledbetter et al. 1963). The cell plate then thickens and separates the two new cells. It is during prophase that a plant cell decides at which plane the new plate will form (Figure 2.6).</p>
