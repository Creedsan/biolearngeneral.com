        <h4>Preface</h4>
        <article class="preface-input">
            <p>BioLearn is a reference material tailored especially for you, the senior high school students. In a few years, you will choose a path in one of the STEM (Science, " Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) strand as your major field of specialization. " This worktext is written with high hope that both the students and instructor will further deepen their appreciation of science, specifically biological sciences. For students, they can wisely choose a career as their major feld of specialization in the future. For instructors they will have a companion material in guiding the students journey to understand the complexity of life forms, concepts of heredity and inheritance of traits, valuable facets of energy transtormation, interconnected nature of biology to chemistry, diversity of life, and evolutionary processes at work.</p>
    <p>We also invite you to have a look at the achievements of Filipino scientists, researchers, and academicians included in your worktext. Then imagine yourself ten years from now. Are you up for the challenge to achieve more than what they have done? </p>
    <p>We hope this will motivate you further to pursue a career in biology, may it be in the academe, research, or industry. We also hope to meet you as one of our colleagues in the future.</p>
