          <h3>Cell Cycle, Cell Death, and Diseases</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p>Recall that mitosis is a process in the cell cycle that forms identical daughter cells and retains a similar copy of the DNA. Errors in mitosis lead to an incorrect copy of the DNA which may produce benign or deadly functional consequences depending on the error. We cannot stress more on the importance of the checkpoint that the cell does in the cell division and cell cycle to maintain the physiological processes of thei organism (Hartwel and Weinert 1989). The positive correlation with the malfunction of these processes to the onset of major diseases such as cancer, stroke, atherosclerosis inflammation, and some neurodegenerative disorders is increasingly proven in various studies. Thus, more work is geared toward further understanding of the cycle of lifei and death of cells to link this to the development of these diseases (Zhivotovsky and Orrenius 2010).</p>
          <h3>Mitosis and Cancer</h3>
          <p>DNA contains the hereditary material in nearly all organisms (more will be discussed about this topic in the next unit). In the process of copying the DNA, two types of error may arise: (1) slent mutation when the DNA is improperly copied and (2) missense mutation, which causes a change in the sequence bringing an impact with the associated function. Missense mutations, when carried over to the next cells, can multiply and aggravate over time. This then leads to cell cycle disruption and formation of tumors (infinitely dividing cell). When the normal checkpoints in the cell cycle are ignored or overridden by a cancer cell, the affected cells undergo uncontrolled cell  division (Evan and Vousden 2001).</p>
          <h3>Chromosome Abnormalities</h3>
          <p>Another group of disorders that is linked to cell cycle is aneuploidy. Aneuploidy is a disorder when a cell has an incorrect number or set of chromosomes. This occurs due to nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I in meiosis when the mitotic checkpoint failed and the spindle fiber did not attach to the centeri of the chromosome. This leads to nondisjunction, failure of the paired chromosomes  to separate. Thus, this results in having one daughter cell with an excess number of chromosomes while the other daughter cell has a missing copy of a chromosome. In humans where 46 is the complete set of chromosomes, Down syndrome has an extra chromosome (number 13) making the orqanism to have 47 total chromosomes  while Turner syndrome lacks one on its sex chromosomes (44 autosomes and X) or 45 chromosomes. These to are common disorders under aneuploidy.</p>
          <h3>Effects on Organelles</h3>
          <p>What happens to the cell organelles if the cell cycle fails to work properly? In cancer cells, where the checkpoints are overridden, the cell organelle becomes unregulated. Organelles can repair itself if the damage occurs during cell division. However, when cell division does not stop, there is no opportunity for organelles to recover which may eventually lead to cell death.</p>
