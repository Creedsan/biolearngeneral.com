          <h3>Cell Types</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p>The difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is said to be the most important distinction among the groups of living things. Deriving from the name itself, eu means "true" while karyon means "nucleus" The main difference is that the eukaryotic cells' chromosomes are enclosed-inside the nucleus while the prokaryotes DNA (pro means "before") is found in a region called nucleoid that has no membrane. However bath types ef cels possess cytoplasm. In prokaryotes, aside from not having a true nucleus, a sem-rigid cell wall is oresent and membrane-bound organelles with specialized functions are absent. </p> <p>All prokaryotic organisms are unicellular (single-celled) which include the members of Kingdom Eubacteria and Archaebacteria. They are much simpler in cellular structure (Figure 1.16) and may occur singly, in pairs, chains, clusters, aggregates, or colonies. Prokaryotic organisms are extremely microscopic ranging from 1-10 um in diameter compared to eukaryotic cells that are bigger with 10-100 um in diameter. I Some species are rod-shaped (bacilli), spherical (coci), spiral, etc. (Figure 1.17).</p><p>All multicellular organisms including humans, which are composed of complex or many cells, are examples of eukarvotic cells. Kingdoms Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia are the members of eukaryotic living things. Being generally larger in size (but still microscopic), eukaryotes' cellular structures perform variety of functions. Plasmal membrane and cell wall are found in both cell types; however, their.composition and structure are highly dissimilar. Different eukaryotic organisms have varying features in terms of the composition, structure, and function of the cell organelles. For instance, fungal cell is different to plant cell in many aspects.</p><p>Another interesting example is the lichens, which for the past 140 years was believed to be a symbiosis between fungi and algae. Spribille et al. (2016) reported that it is not a binary symbiosis but it is composed of three symbiotic partners: an ascomycetous funqus, a photosynthetic alqa, and unexpectedly, a basidiomycetous yeast. Based on this recent discovery, the yeast cells in lichens are found at the cortex of the thallus which may be important for its shape. </p>
          <h3>Let's Review</h3>
          <p>- Cells are the smallest functional unit that make up all living things.</p> <p>- The cell membrane is a dynamic barrier that is semi-permeable and fluid, composed of a phospholipid bilayer and proteins.</p> <p>- The endomembrane system is composed of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, lysosomes, transport vesicles, vacuoles, and other membrane bound components.</p><p>- Unicellular organisms have different cell structures than multicellular organisms; plant cells have different structures from animal cells so as the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</p>
