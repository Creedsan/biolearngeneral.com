          <h3>Cell Cycle</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p> One of the distinct characteristics of living things is being able to perpetuate themselves. Cells need to undergo cycles as part of their growth and to repair or replace damaged ones. Cell cycle enables an organism to continue its existence by multiplying itself in controlled and systematic processes. This chapter will enhancei your understanding on one of the key features of life which is cell reproduction. This will provide you with the concepts on the diferent stages of cell cycle and the two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis, and explain their significance on an organism. </p> <p>All types of cells have the ability to reproduce through cell division, which is part of the step of the cell cycle. Making new cells ensures that organisms grow and increase in number. Even when the cell is not dividing, DNA duplication is taking place in preparation for the next cell cycle. It is also during this phase that cell grows or organelles are built and the normal metabolic activities of the cell take place. As thel DNA is completely duplicated, the cell is now ready to undergo mitosis, which results in the separation of the DNA copies. Each nucleus of the daughter cells receives a set of chromosomes identical to its parent ell. Finally, it will be followed by cytokinesis or the division of the cytoplasm where the cell divides producing two new cells. </p>
