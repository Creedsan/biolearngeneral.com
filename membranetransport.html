          <h3>Membrane Transport</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p>Phospholipids and proteins are the principal components of membranes; however, different types of organisms have varying compositions and structures, too. Generally, a phospholipid molecule having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic heads forms the plasma membrane. How are phospholipids and proteins arranged in the membranes? Figure 3.2 shows the fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972). It is fluid in structure with embedded or attached proteins and some carbohydrates qive it a"mosaic" feature. This model simply says that i proteins are sandwiched in between two phospholipid layers. The lipid molecules arei amphipathic, that is, they possess both polar hydrophilic (water loving) and nonpolar hydrophobic (water repelling) ends. The hydrophilic region is in the form of a head while the hydrophobic part contains two tails of fatty acids.</p> <p> The red polar head separates the yellow hydrophobic tails from the aqueous cytosolic and extracellular environments. This phospholipid bilayer performs self. assembly to form a continuous, spherical structure around the cell content. This complex interaction can include noncovalent interactions such as van der Wals,  electrostatic, and hydrogen bonds to maintain the integrity of the membrane. The bilayer does not allow the passage of ions and polar molecules (e.g, amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and ions) butit ermits the passive diffusion of hydrophobic molecules. This affords the cell the ability to control the movement of these substances via transmembrane protein complexes such as pores, channels, and gates. </p> <p>Some protein molecules are both on the inside and on the outer side of the lipid bilayer while some are only on the inner side of the bilayer membrane. These proteins which pass into the bilipid layer are called integral proteins which are like tunnels or channels for the passage of water and/or other substances (Fiqure 3.3).</p> <p>Integral membrane proteins can be classified as uniporter, symporter, and antiporter. Uniporter transports substances in a unidirectional manner depending on the concentration gradient. Symporters transports different types of molecules in the cell membrane at the same time and the opposite happens for antiporter (Figure 3.4).</p> <p>Other proteins found on the cell membrane are known as extrinsic or peripheral proteins which act as receptors for hormones, recognition centers, and antigens. For instance, glycophorins are proteins present in red blood cells which act as antigen determinant that can tell whether a foreign tissue can be incorporated or rejected by the host organism (Chasis and Mohandas 1992). The structure of the cell membrane plays active and passive roles in the transport of substances across it. Generally speaking, substances can spread out in a given solution because of the random movement of its particles. This is called diffusion which occurs when particles move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Diffusion is an example of passive transport because energy is not a requirement during the process. Diffusion is an important cellular process, for instance, the movement of oxygen from air into the blood and the carbon dioxide out of the blood into the surrounding air in the lungs are some of the biological importance of this process. </p> <p>If diffusion is taking place across a semi-permeable membrane, the transport is called osmosis.Ithappens when two areas of differing concentration gradients are being separated by a partially permeable membrane. Specifically, osmosis is the movement of water through a semi-permeable membrane from an area of higher concentration to a relatively low concentration of water. This principle qoverns the movement of water inside the body to maintain homeostasis (Prokop and Fancovicova 2006).</p> <p>How does this principle work? The cells in our body are bathed in tissue fluid. i Water and small particles can easily pass in and out down the concentration gradient; i however, many important substances and macromolecules cannot pass through such as amino acids, glucose, etc. Hence, it is essential that the concentration of dissolved substances in the tissue fluid is similar to the concentration of the cell contents. If thei solution outside the cell is more concentrated than the cell contents, water will movei out of the cell by osmosis. If the solution outside the cll is less concentrated than the cell contents, then water will move into the cell by osmosis.</p>
          <h3>Facilitated Diffusion</h3> <p>Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport which relies on carrier proteins in order for the substances to move down their concentration gradient (Figure 3.6). There are substances like amino acids, glucose, and some ions that cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane because of the hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer. Thus, something that could "facilitate" their movement is necessary and is accomplished through the integral proteins embedded in the plasma membrane. They serve as gates which open and close in requlating the flow of substances.</p>
          <h3>Active Transport</h3>
          <p>When the cell needs nutrients at a higher concentration than it typically receivesi or at a faster rate than what simple diffusion can offer, it utilizes additional metabolc energy against the concentration gradient to move molecules across the membrane. This process is known as active transport.</p>
          <p>Various mechanisms apply to this form of transport. Proteins can actively pump the molecules coupled with ATP hydrolysis (transport ATPases) and possibly move molecules by co-transport. Co-transport occurs when the diffusion of one molecule toward the concentration gradient leads to the diffusion of another molecules against the concentration gradient (antiporter). For example, in animal cells, the gradient of Nat is regulated by the movement of K" using the Na-K" ATPases (Figure 3.7). This form of co-transport is important in maintaining low intracellular concentration of Nat and high K' as well as in establishing a membrane electrical potential. Membranei voltaqe or membrane potential is a unique feature of a cell due to various reasons: (1) the cytoplasm maintains a negatively charged environment which is favorable for thei passive uptake of positively charged molecules to enter the cell; (2) pumping out of cations (H', Nat, etc.) generates a concentration gradient for use in the active transport of other molecules; and (3) a change in membrane potential creates signals to control voltage-gated channels of transmission of siqnal in the cell.This membrane potentiall is created by active transport of ions, for example Na*, from inside to outside of thecell. This results in a slightly negative internal environment. With the aid of Na-K' ATPases, the transport of three Nat out of the cell s coupled with two K' entering the cell which results in a net negative charge (Blanco and Mercer 1998). </p>
          <h3>Endocytosis and Exocytosis</h3>
          <p>In the event that a large moleculeneeds to be transported across the membrane (ea. complex carbohydrates, enzymes, and lipids), the substance will be enclosed in a membranebound sac composed of the plasma membrane or the internal membrane. This mechanism is known as vesicle-mediated transport. This process works both ways, meaning, required materials can go in (endocytosis) and out (exocytosis) of the cell.</p>
          <p>During the intake of large molecules or endocytosis, the portion of the plasma membrane invaginates to enclose the substance. This then pinches off to form a vesicle that holds the molecule. If the vesicle holds a solid substance, then the process is known as phagocytosis (Fiqure 3.8), but if the vesicle contains a liquid material, then the process is called pinocytosis. In other instances,  receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs wherein the molecule can bind to the surfacel of the membrane. The binding of the molecule stimulates the internal surface of thei membrane to fold. The area where the molecule binds to the receptor has a specialized protein in the internal layer of the adjacent membrane. This specialized protein which serves as a coating is known as clathrin. This coated pit anchors the receptor in place and initiates the folding to form the coated vesicle (Rejman et al. 2004). Receptormediated transport is not compatible with all arge molecules due to the specificity of receptors, similar to the behavior of enzymes (Figure 3.9).</p> <p>In the process of exocytosis, vesicles coming from the inside of the cell fuse with the plasma membrane which travels across the membrane to be released outside the cell. This type of transport usually applies to enzymes and hormones. </p>
