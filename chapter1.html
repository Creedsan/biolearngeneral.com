          <h4>Chapter 1:</h4>
          <h3>Introduction to Cell Biology</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p> There are more than 350,000 species of known plants and more is to be discovered and named in the next years. Their fascinating morphology and their ability to regulate and maintain homeostasis are studied by botanists. In this chapter, you will learn the different plant systems that function together to maintain the plant's internal conditions.</p> <p>What do paramecium and whales have in common? Why is the shape of a neuron different from that of a red blood cell even if it carries the same genetic code? What do cancerous cells mean?</p> <p>Understanding the basics of cell structure will lead us to the answers to these questions. This chapter will expound on the core concepts of cell biology. As students go through this chapter, they will be able to understand the basic structure among alll organisms, that is, the cell.</p> <p>This chapter will also show how cell theories served as the stepping stone to knowing life in relation to the role of organelles to the overall function of the cell. Thus, i students will be capable of identifying the most important distinction between groups of organisms and classifying major cell types. </p>
