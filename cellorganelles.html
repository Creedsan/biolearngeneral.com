          <h3>Cell Organelles</h3>
          <article class="input-overview">
          <p>All living organisms are composed of one or many cells. The cell is the building block of life, which is able to control and execute several functions in all types of organsms. The cell is generally microscopic, but its size varies from one organism to another and also from the parts of the organism itself. Cell structures can only be observed under high magnification electron microscope and are separated internally into numerous membranous compartments caled organelles (little organs). These organelles perform a variety of functions like production of proteins, storage of important materials, harvesting energy, repairing cell parts, digestion of substances, and maintaining the shape and structure of the cell, among others. Since the organelles are compartmentalized, one system does not interfere with functions of the otheri systems but their roles are interdependent.</p><p>Starting from the outside, a cell membrane encloses the cell and separates it from external environment. It actively regulates the kind of substance that goes in and out of the cell. The cell membrane consists of a bilayer of phospholipid with integral (embedded) and peripheral (attached) proteins, as well as enzymes, receptor proteins, and glycoproteins (Fiqure 1.5). One important feature of the membrane is its fluidity. Lipid molecules can move laterally across the membrane together with the irregularly arranged proteins (mosaic), thereby referred to as fluid mosaic. It is also selectively permeable to allow some molecules to pass through the membrane such as H20, CO2, and O2, and prevent polar molecules and ions to enter or exit the cell freely. This does not mean that these molecules are incapable of moving across the membrane. Specialized transmembrane proteins enable the fast transport of ions and polar molecules to maintain homeostasis.</p><p>A jelly-like substance which is mainly composed of water with dissolved substances such as salt and proteins is called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm isi responsible for the fluid nature of the cell's internal environment and that which allows the organelles to suspend dynamically. The nucleus, which is the control center of thei cell isenclosed in a double membrane which selectively permits certain materials ori compounds (e.a. mRNA) to exit. The double membrane is separated by approximately 50 nm. The outer membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. In thei nucleus, a long strand of DNA molecule is present which wounds around histonei proteins to form a helical structure, termed as chromatin strand. During cell division, thesechromatin strandsfurther become condensed and thicken to form chromosomes. These chromosomes are visible when stained and viewed in a light microscope. Within the nucleus, a suborganelle known as nucleolus is present (Fiqure 1.6a). It is where thei subunits of the ribosome are assembled and include the synthesis and maturation of ribosomal RNA for release in the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. Around 10,000 ribosomes per minute are needed by the cell, which means that the nucleolus should produce huge amount of ribosomal subunits to sustain protein synthesis in the cell. The nucleolus is easily recognized under the light microscope as a slightly darker region (Fiouure 1 6b).</p><p>Millions of ribosomes are present in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. This is the main structure involved in protein synthesis. Each ribosome is made up of two subunits coming from the nucleolus. The subunits from the nucleolus will be associated in the mRNA molecule forming the functional unit for protein synthesis. Ribosomes subsequently move across the mRNA strand and new ribosomes continuously attach to the end of the strand forming a polyribosome or polysome.</p><p>The cell's endomembrane system is composed of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi bodies, lysosomes, transport vesicles, vacuoles, and other membrane-bound components. The functions of these organelles are connected from the synthesis of materials, transporting, packaging, metabolism, and even detoxification of substances. Their structures are different and so with the individual tasks they perform.</p><p>Endoplasmic reticu/um (ER) is a membranous system of interconnected tubules (Fiqure 1.7) which served as the transport system of the cell. It is composed of two types based on the presence or absence of attached ribosomes:the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) appears grainy in structure in the electron micrograph, thus named as rough. It is responsible in the production of secretory proteins such as glycoproteins; it is also where membranes are produced for the cell and its expanding membrane forms transport vesicles, which is important in the transit of products being made by the ribosomes attached in the rough ER. On the other hand, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER) lacks ribosomes on its outer surface. Various metabolic processes such as metabolism of carbohydrates, lipid synthesis, and detoxification of drugs, chemicals, and poisons are performed in this organelle.</p><p>Golgi bodies (or Golgi apparatus/Golgi complex) consist of stacks or piles of flattened sacs called cisternae, which functions in the packaging, sorting, and refining of products that the cells are making. For example, the products of the ER will be modified by the Golgi apparatus and then transported to other destinations in the cell.</p><p>Vacuole is one organelle that is larger in plants than in animal cells. The vacuole has the ability to enlarge as plant cells absorb water. The central vacuole or tonoplast serves as the main compartment for storing essential organic and inorganic compounds. It is also a disposal site for substances that are not needed by the cell or that could harm the cell.</p><p>Lysosome is an exclusive organelle for animal cells which carries out intracellular diqestion. It contains hydrolytic enzymes that are used to digest all kinds of macromolecules. It also recycles intracellular materials through autophaqy, where organelles that are damagedwill be digested and the resulting monomers will bereused by the cell for repair, maintenance, and making of necessary cellular components. </p><p>Eukaryotic cells which will be further discussed in the next section contain organelles that can convert energy to another usable form that the cell may be able to utilize. According to one theory on cellular evolution, mitochondrion and chloroplast are considered autonomous organisms which were engulfed by an ancient cell. This then coexisted into a single cell by establishing a mutualistic interaction (Margulis 1981). In fact, these two organelles have their own DNA and ribosomes. This is known as the endosymbiotic theory (Fiqure 1.9). Eukaryotic cells can have one or many mitochondria and/or chloroplasts depending on the function, activity, and nature of the cell.</p><p>Mitochondrion (pl. mitochondria) is the powerhouse of the cell where cellular respiration takes place. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the usable form of energy for the cell to perform its functions. It is generated by metabolizing sugars.fats and other energy sources with the presence of oxygen. The mitochondrion has outer and inner membranes. The outer membrane is smooth while cristae (the inner membrane) has i infoldings giving large surface area for metabolic activities (Figure 1.10). The matrix is one of the two compartments of cristae containing different enzymes, DNA, and ribosomes. These enzymes catalyze the process of cellular respiration.</p><p>Chloroplast is only found in plant cell and other photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms; it is the site for food production. By capturing light or solar energy, thei chloroplast converts it to organic compounds such as sugar from carbon dioxide and water. Chloroplast contains the green piqment chlorophyll which functions in glucosei production. The chloroplasts internal structure is composed of flattened sacs called thylakoids and each stack is called granum (pl. grana). Stroma is the fluid outside thei thylakoid where enzymes, the chloroplast's DNA, and ribosomes are found (Fiqurei 1.11). The process of photosynthesis is discussed in detail in Unit ll.</p><p>Other structures present in the cell are the components of the cytoskeleton which establishes the form of the cell and holds the organelles in place. The cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments.</p><p>Microflaments are made up of actin molecules which form fine fibers of approximately 7-8 nm dlameter; whereas, microtubules are composed of tubulin forming a hollow cylinder of 25 nm In diameter. In terms of size, the intermediate filaments are around 8-10-nm that make it "intermediate" in size. Unlike microtubules and microfilaments, the intermediate filament is rigid and resists stretching. </p><p>Some cells also possess cilia and flagella which are cellular projections that are used for movement of cell over a surface. Structure is similar for both flagella and cilia as shown in the cross section of the axoneme, the central strand of flagellum or cilium (Figure 1.13); however, the length and frequency mark the difference. Flagellar length ranges from 20 to 100 um with fewer number on the cell; whereas, cilium length ranges from 2-20 um, which is numerous and found all over the cell surface. Flagella and cilia are covered by the plasma membrane and are connected to the cell by an array of microtubules arranged as axoneme. This is composed of nine pairs or doublet of microtubules arranged in cylindrical form. Fine fibers connect the doublet and each doublet contains dynein arms (protein that appears as two short arms of the doublet). Movement using flagella and cilia is a result of the sliding of adjacent microtubule doublets. The dynein arm initially attaches to the adjacent doublet, changes its conformation, and then dissociates. Flagella create a propelling motion; whereas, cilal beat back and forth to move the cell. These structures can both exist in the same cell or may be present either as flagella only or cilia only.</p>
